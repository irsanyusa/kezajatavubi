The dreaded cover letter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cover letters can be absolute torture, and it feels like there are a million ways to screw them up. Is yours too formal or informal? Too long or short? Too much information or too vague?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s an upside, though: Making your cover letter awesome doesn’t have to be a long, difficult process. In fact, as I’ve written more and more cover letters over time (and started helping dozens of other people write theirs), they’ve actually become (gasp!) fun.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Below, I’ve listed the 16 most important tips I’ve learned to make crafting a cover letter into an easy and pain-free process. Half of the tips are related to what you write, and the other half are tiny things that’ll make sure your cover letter is better than the rest. By the end of the list, there’s no way a hiring manager will be able to shuffle you to the bottom of the pile. Or you know…delete your email…</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>8 Tips for Cover Letters That Grab Hiring Managers’ Attention</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>1. Describe a pain point</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s the most important question any cover letter should answer: What problem would hiring you solve?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Notice that this question is about the <i>company’s</i> problem, not your desire to land the job! Tricky, I know.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But think about it: If a company has put up a job description, it means they have a pain point and need a solution. For example, if a company is hiring a web designer, it means they don’t think their current layout is up to snuff and they’re looking for someone who can get them there. <i>That’s</i> the problem they need solved, and that’s what your cover letter should make clear in first few sentences.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>2. Don’t regurgitate your resume</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is a tip that you’ve probably heard before, but it happens <i>all the time</i>: Don’t use your cover letter to simply restate your resume!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Your cover letter is the perfect place to expand on things that your resume doesn’t detail, illustrate the more intangible reasons why you’re perfect for the job, and explain any particular circumstances that warrant discussion (for example, if you’re making a sudden or drastic career change).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong><i>Skillcrush: </i></strong><a href=# rel=noopener><i>22 Things to Remove From Your Resume Immediately</i></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>3. The tone should match the company</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cover letters are great for companies not only because they can see if you can solve the problem at hand, but also because they give hiring managers a sense of whether or not you understand the company culture.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">How do they figure this out? Tone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Take a look at a company’s website, how its social media is phrased, and how its employees talk about it online. Is this company a little more informal and fun? Is it buttoned-up and corporate? Your cover letter should be written in a tone similar to that of the company’s copy. Obviously put a professional spin on it, but keep the company’s culture in mind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>4. Keep the focus on the company</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hiring managers assume that if you’re applying to a particular job, that must mean you really want that job. Thus, you don’t need to spend your entire cover letter reiterating how badly you want the job and how great the experience would be for <i>you</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s okay to spend one or two sentences tops explaining your love for the company, but then it’s time to turn the tables.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The majority of your cover letter should be illustrating to a potential employer what hiring you would do for their company. Again, focus on the pain point: What talents and skills do you have that would help this organization tremendously?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>5. Use your numbers</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A big problem I’ve seen in lots of cover letters is that they tend to be very vague in describing any notable accomplishments or achievements.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For example, instead of saying that you have had “a great deal of success as an email marketer,” use your numbers: “I spearheaded an entire newsletter redesign that resulted in a 500% increase in our open rate, which proves…”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Numbers also add intrigue and leave hiring managers wanting to hear more!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Psst! This tip holds true for resumes! (</i><a href=# rel=noopener><i>More here</i></a><i>.) Adding numbers and statistics is a solid way to stand out!</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>6. Make your anecdotes short</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While examples can make your cover letter super effective, many people make the mistake of including unnecessary or irrelevant information when using anecdotes that make them drag on and lose their<i>umph</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">My personal rule is to make any example or story no longer than three sentences so that you can avoid going overboard and wasting valuable space. Here’s how to break it down:</p><li><b>Sentence 1:</b> Introduce the skill you’re highlighting.</li><li><b>Sentences 2:</b> Explain the situation where you showed off this skill.</li><li><b>Sentence 3:</b> What was the end result? Explain what it did for the company and what it proves about your character.</li><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>7. Make your opening line memorable</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If the big opener to your cover letter is “I’m applying for Position X at Company Y” or “My name is…” it’s time to press the backspace button. There are two things wrong with both of these phrases:</p><li><b>They’re redundant, so you’re taking up precious space!</b> A hiring manager is already going to know your name from your application as well as which position you’re applying for. No need to repeat it.</li><li><b>They’re generic and unmemorable.</b> Give your hiring manager something to get excited about or be intrigued by.</li><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So, how can you start a cover letter with something that has a little more pizzazz? Try opening with a favorite short anecdote, a quote that best describes you as a professional, or your personal tagline.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>8. Everything should relate to the job description</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As you write (and then read through) every line of your cover letter, ask yourself: <i>How does this sentence relate to the job description?</i> If you find yourself going on tangents or including facts that don’t prove your ability to excel at the job or understand the company culture, take it out.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And if you need some help making sense of exactly what will prove you are qualified for the job at hand, check out these <a href=# rel=noopener>10 Tips for Deciphering Tech Job Listings</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>8 Tips for Putting the Finishing Touches on Your Cover Letter</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>1. Research whom to address your letter to</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Scrap the “To Whom It May Concern” greeting and do some research to find out who will be reading your cover letter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In some cases, employers will be super helpful and straight up tell you whom to address that cover letter to. If you aren’t so lucky, a quick Google search can help, or if you have a connection to a potential employer, have a professional contact ask around to see if they can get a name.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If all else fails and you really want to avoid the dreaded “To Whom It May Concern” line, feel free to shoot the company an email. I did this before when I was applying to a company that had a plethora of people on its editorial and HR teams and I had no idea who’d be hiring me.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s the quick template I used:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Hi there,</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’m applying to [name of company]’s [name of job title] position, and I was having some trouble figuring out whom specifically to address the cover letter to. Is there a particular person or department I should direct it to?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Thanks so much for your time!</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Best,</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>[Your name]</i></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>2. Be smart with hyperlinks</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you’re going to use hyperlinks in your cover letter, there are two important things to keep in mind. First, try not to include more than two or three links tops in a cover letter (like an online portfolio or personal website). All links should be relevant, and your cover letter shouldn’t be used as a dumping ground for everything you’ve ever created!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Second, make sure you add context to a hyperlink to both draw attention to it and to make the hiring manager understand that it’s worth his or her time to click on. For example, if you’re referencing a recent design project you did, add that said project can be found “in my online portfolio” and add a hyperlink.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>3. Delete extra images, clipart, emoticons and emojis</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is a no-brainer: Regardless of how “chill” the company says it is, keep clipart, emoticons, emojis, cute pictures of your puppy, and any other images OUT of your cover letter!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Squeeze an emoji into a cover email if you’re SUPER confident it’s appropriate. Otherwise, steer clear.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>4. Keep it short (like, really short)</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I’ve seen dozens of cover letters in the past month, and the biggest issue across the board is that people make their cover letters way too long.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s the general rule of thumb to follow: Your cover letter should be a single page (no more!) and around 300-350 words. If you’re writing a cover email, three to five sentences works (since you usually have attachments or links for a hiring manager to click on).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>5. Keep your font professional (and normal)</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">True story: I once received a cover letter from a friend where he’d had kept his writing to one page—but it was in eight-point font. Yikes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Your cover letter font size should be normal (aim for between 10-point and 12-point), and your font should be straightforward and professional. Favorites include Arial, Times New Roman, and Georgia. Just say no to Curly Q or Comic Sans.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong><i>Skillcrush: </i></strong><a href=# rel=noopener><i>8 Free Font Pairings You Have to See</i></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>6. Break up your paragraphs</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nothing provokes fear in people faster than a wall of text. Hiring managers get a visual of your physical cover letter before they ever read it, and if their first reaction is, “Oh god, it’s all one paragraph!” that’s not a good sign.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Instead, break up your cover letter into smaller paragraphs of three or four sentences each. It’s so much more aesthetically pleasing, and the person reading your cover letter will thank you.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>7. Cut the vague professional jargon</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As with in a resume, using phrases like “team player,” “self-motivated,” or “results driven” only makes your cover letter generic and unmemorable. Use more lively language, or better yet, use specific examples to prove your point.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>8. Re-read your cover letter over (and over and over)</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Editing is the most tedious but also the most necessary part of any cover letter writing you do. Start by printing your cover letter out and reading it aloud. I also recommend reading the cover letter starting with the last sentence and working your way up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another pro tip: Definitely get someone else to read your cover letter. In many cases, you might think your writing is pristine, but a friend will find at least a couple typos and point out some places where your wording is a little clunky.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Getting that perfect cover letter doesn’t have to be a time-consuming process. Use these tips and you’ll be snagging the job (and impressing potential employers with your savvy) in no time!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Skillcrush: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>The Ultimate Guide the Perfect Email Cover Letter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><i>Lily is a writer, editor, and social media manager, as well as co-founder of </i><a href=# rel=noopener><i>The Prospect</i></a><i>, the world’s largest student-run college access organization.
