Mostly, men choose gold, red, black, or silver caps regardless of their attire. Some men also accessorize their hats with vibrant feathers to add more flare to the outfit.</p><h4>A shirt and pants</h4><p class=align-left>The minimal dressing for a groom mostly consists of a high-collared, long-sleeved shirt, which flows down to the knees, and pants. The groom might add a heavy Agbada with lots of embroidery on top of his native shirt and trousers.</p><p class=align-left>Igbo men also wear an Isiagu or a plain white shirt that reaches the knees. Isiagu is a pullover shirt, usually embroidered with lion heads, crowns or other large symbols.</p><p class=align-left>Some grooms like wearing simple trousers that are traditionally wide-legged, while others, however, go for the wrapper, which can be as short or as long as they want. The pants usually vary from flabby to tight, but the latter detail depends on personal preferences. The traditional groom's attire can also be accessorized with coral necklaces, gold chains and walking sticks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2vapdqm1tdu.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best Muslim wedding gowns</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Igbo traditional wedding attire is an essential part of the Igbo culture.
