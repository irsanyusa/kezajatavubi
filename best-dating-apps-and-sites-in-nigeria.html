OK Cupid</p><p>1. <a href=# id=998c029e-96a2-4fc5-9628-bf8335be2938 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Bingdum</a>: Bingdum is for sure the best dating app in Nigeria. Bingdum currently has so many exciting features that keeps their users engaged and want to come back.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This apps offers their users rooms to discuss about similar interest, such as rooms for users who are looking for true love, marriage, sports, universities, states, local government areas or just hangout.</p><p>This app is a location based app that is meant to link your up with partners around your area. you don't even need to get matched to chat with anyone or pay any fee. Bingdum is totally free to use. Bingdum also provides a verification feature to prove a user is real.</p><p>2. Tinder: Tinder is a dating app that allows you to see photos of local people. Swiping right to "like" a person or right to view more photographs till you discover one you like can be used to choose a partner.</p><p>Someone is notified when you swipe right on their photo, and if they like it back, you've found a match. If there is a match, you will be notified. Following that, you can initiate communication by messaging one another.</p><p>Have it in mind that tinder has a paid and free plan, but to enjoy this app, you are advised to subscribe to a plan.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>3. Tagged: Tagged began as a website designed to bring people together for romance and friendship in 2004. After the platform's mobile version was introduced seven years ago, Tagged currently boasts over 300 million members.</p><p>Tagged is primarily utilised in the United States, but it is available in 24 other languages. Therefore, users can still use the app and communicate with others even if they don't speak English.</p><p>4. Bumble: The closest competitor to Tinder is Bumble, which is also one of the most widely used dating applications. In order to disrupt the dating industry, Badoo's founder Andrey Andreev and Whitney Wolfe Herd co-founded the app in 2014.</p><p>In order to match possible matches, Bumble used the same swiping mechanism as Tinder, but it only lets women initiate contact.</p><p>A woman's match will also vanish within the first 24 hours if she doesn't reply.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>5. Zoosk: Those who utilise Zoosk can connect with local singles. Users of diverse backgrounds can access the platform, which has 40 million subscribers, in more than 80 countries.</p><p>You may create a profile, search and discover, and communicate with others using this dating app, all of which are available to free users. To further aid in keeping people secure while they are online, Zoosk offers a wealth of security and safety measures.</p><p>6. Match: This app, which is owned by the Match Group, is a modern addition to the 1995-launched online dating service Match.com. The app's services and marketing are tailored to support users who are more bent on starting a meaningful relationship.</p><p>Most of the functionality of the original platform is carried over onto this mobile analogue. But like most dating applications these days, Match has adopted Tinder's swiping feature, following modern business trends.</p><p>7. OK Cupid: Another sister of Tinder is OkCupid, which Match Group purchased in 2011. The OkCupid app, like many of the dating apps on this list, started off as a website before becoming a mobile app.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The OkCupid team has exceptional knowledge of the niche. In particular, OkCupid accepts users of any gender and sexual orientation. In addition to being free to use, this app provides subscriptions beginning at $7.99 a month.</p><p>8. MeetMe: The origins of MeetMe may be traced to its 2005 social networking platform introduction.</p><p>This is an enjoyable, amiable, and cost-free dating app that finds new individuals in the area that are interested in small talk and have similar hobbies. It functions more like an on-the-go coffee shop or bar where people may meet others.</p><p>Over 61 million people use the app regularly. It has the usual dating functions, like live streaming, chat, and search. The Blind Date game, which pairs participants at random according to their preferences, was introduced by MeetMe in 2020.</p><p>9. Badoo: Another well-known dating app that started as a website is called Badoo. All things considered, Badoo is rather typical and provides users with most of the normal functions, such as matching with other users via swiping.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Russian businessman Andrey Andreev, who founded Bumble after Badoo failed to gain traction in the US, released this app in 2006. Badoo has grown its market share outside of the US, particularly in Europe and South America.</p><p>The second-most downloaded dating app worldwide is called Badoo. The app generated $209.2 million in sales in 2022.</p><p>10. Happn: In 2013, the French dating app Happn was released. Its business strategy deviates little from that of most competitors in the market.</p><p>The software matches users with persons they have already met on the street based on their geolocation, as opposed to traditional matching with strangers.</p><p>On its website, the firm claims that Happn currently has 100 million or so active members and 1.5 million new singles per month.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>#FeatureByBingdum</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7wZ6qrWWUlsGqusZmmKmoo2Kur7CMrKCtnaNitq95zaKenqqZlnyvfZOhcKuk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./death-by-100-degrees.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Death By 100 Degrees | TIME">&larr;
