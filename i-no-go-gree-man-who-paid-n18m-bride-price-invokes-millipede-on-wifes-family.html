But we do not blame her because no one with a sane mind will stay in that kind of place if that juju is not neutralized.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>We have also seen somebody she brought to come and do some things here, and we know that they are not church people; that person is not a pastor, she lives in one of the thatch houses in the compound of the native doctor somewhere in the community."</p><p>The acting village head of the Ekpene Ikot Effio Anang community, who is also the youth leader of the area, <strong>Edem Edet</strong>, said it would be foolish on the part of the community to allow the estranged husband to remain in the community or build houses on the land given to him by the people because they have seen what he is capable of doing.</p><p>“We have seen the kind of person he is; we now know that he is not supposed to live among us because he has a questionable character.</p><p>This kind of man can poison people where they gather to relax or drink; he is even capable of killing to possess what belongs to another man. For this reason and other things that I would not like to go into, he can no longer live with us.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He came to me a few days ago to tell me what he wants, but from the way he spoke, I think he still loves Esther, but it is too late because he took it too far.</p><p>Even the militants went to the place and they are very angry with what he did because the case was still before them, yet he went behind to contract a native doctor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02igZqafYrSwecarnJ5lnZa7bsPHqGSpmZmZeq99l6Zkm6qZmbJuvNGimp5lmaPDsLfErGSmoZyhtrGxw55kqKZdrLansdJmnZqlmaHGcH%2FWbGtxmmc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1568542-shauna-raes-age-height-birthday-net-worth-relationships.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shauna Raes age, height, birthday, net worth, relationships">&larr;
