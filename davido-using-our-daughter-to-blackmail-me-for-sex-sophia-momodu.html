J. Bashua</strong>, by a legal team led by <strong>Chief (Dr) Anthony Idigbe (SAN) </strong>of Punuka Attorneys & Solicitors.</p><p>Chief Idigbe drew attention to the publication of a hearing notice in a national newspaper by Davido’s legal team, in which the name of his daughter was mentioned four times.</p><p>The judge agreed with Chief Idigbe that while the press were free to report, the child’s name ought not to be mentioned at all.</p><p>The judge then asked members of the press, litigants and all other counsel not involved in the case, to leave the courtroom during the hearing.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Before they left, Chief Idigbe, with the court’s permission, drew the attention of members of the press to Section 143 of the Child’s Rights Law of Lagos State 2015.</p><p>It provides that in a case involving a minor: “No person must be allowed to attend court, other than the members and officers of the court and the parties to the case.</p><p>It also provides that their solicitors and counsel, parents and guardians of the child and other persons directly concerned in the case were free to be allowed in.”</p><p>Chief Idigbe also referred to Section 144 of the Law, which prohibits the publication of a child’s name.</p><p>The section reads: “No person must publish the name, address, school, photograph, or anything likely to lead to the identification of a child in a matter before the court, except as required by the provisions of this law.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The SAN further referred to Section 145 of the Child Rights Law, which provides: “The proceedings in the court must be conducive to the best interest of the child and must be conducted in an atmosphere of understanding, allowing the child to express himself and participate in the proceedings.”</p><p>Momodu, in the counter-affidavit, also faulted the publication of the suit in a national newspaper.</p><p>“The applicant (Davido) in publishing this suit in a national newspaper has exposed our daughter to great danger.</p><p>“I would have to implement extra security measures to ensure the continued safety of our daughter in school,” she stated.</p><p>At the end of the proceedings, it was learnt that the court referred the case for possible settlement by the Alternative Dispute Resolution section of the court during Settlement Week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGadmaaesbB51Kygp59dpMKzecOarKCgpJq%2FbsDOZpmlmZOguqK1y2aknmWWpL9uv8SxZKynoJ22onnMqKSonKVksbG81XCvrA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1181032-glo-recharge-bonus-codes-details-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Glo recharge bonus codes and details">&larr;
