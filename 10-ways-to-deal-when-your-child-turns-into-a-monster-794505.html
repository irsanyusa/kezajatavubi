Recognizing the patterns of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s behavior and dealing with them can be&nbsp;quite a&nbsp;task, even for experienced parents. However, facing the problem and fixing it&nbsp;can help build a&nbsp;strong emotional connection between you and the child, and boost their <a href=#>problem-solving skills</a>.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>understands how challenging and frustrating children’s behavior can&nbsp;be, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;found out what techniques can help you come to&nbsp;terms with even the naughtiest child.</p><p><h2>1. Show to&nbsp;your child the connection between their behavior and its consequences.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a06/704/00332f5ce685d1930113c29359.jpg><p>Children have to&nbsp;see <a href=#>the natural consequences</a> of&nbsp;their behavior to&nbsp;realize that they have done something wrong. This technique helps the child understand how the world works and makes them more independent in&nbsp;being able to&nbsp;foresee the consequences of&nbsp;their own actions.</p><p><strong>How this works: </strong>Parents shouldn’t try to&nbsp;prevent natural things that have been caused by&nbsp;the child’s behavior from happening. However, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that they should just let it&nbsp;go, especially when the child’s behavior becomes dangerous. Parents shouldn’t try to&nbsp;act like the bad guys or&nbsp;show their superiority to&nbsp;the child. It’s important to&nbsp;be&nbsp;supportive and be&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;deal with the outcome of&nbsp;a&nbsp;child’s behavior.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong></p><ul><li>If&nbsp;the child refuses to&nbsp;eat their lunch, they’ll have to&nbsp;stay hungry until dinner.</li></ul><ul><li>If&nbsp;the child acts like a&nbsp;bully, no&nbsp;one will want to&nbsp;play with them until they apologize.</li></ul><p><h2>2. Let your children learn from their mistakes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/91e/add/c9eb505ee086718e54105347b2.jpg><p>Parents can be&nbsp;overprotective sometimes, so&nbsp;it’s important to&nbsp;teach the child to&nbsp;fix the consequences of&nbsp;their behavior and learn from that experience. Besides, some children may get <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>defensive</a> when their parent starts telling them off, tries to&nbsp;invoke shame, or&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;make the child feel humiliated.</p><p><strong>How this works: </strong>This technique is&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeper version of&nbsp;the previous one, since it&nbsp;requires the children to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;fix their mistakes themselves. Parents should help children to&nbsp;process their emotions and give them a&nbsp;hand if&nbsp;it’s needed. But they shouldn’t interfere too much: the aim is&nbsp;to&nbsp;moderate the appropriate response from the child. For example, they can politely ask for help, apologize, etc.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>The deadline for the school assignment is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tomorrow, but the child hasn’t put in&nbsp;enough effort to&nbsp;finish their work on&nbsp;time. Instead of&nbsp;staying up&nbsp;late and helping the child with their homework, their parents should let them get the bad grade and find out how to&nbsp;fix the situation.</p><p><h2>3. Find the roots of&nbsp;their bad behavior.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb7/bfa/4dc30e5897b4c29cbe0a1f75b9.jpg><p>Your child may be&nbsp;throwing a&nbsp;tantrum or&nbsp;acting angry not because of&nbsp;their bad temper, but because they don’t know how to&nbsp;<a href=#>deal with their emotions</a> yet. It’s essential to&nbsp;provide children an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;talk things through and determine the reason for their discomfort.</p><p><strong>How this works: </strong>When a&nbsp;child starts acting out, remove them from the situation. Find a&nbsp;quiet place where you can talk about their behavior, feelings, and actions. Explain to&nbsp;the child that it’s completely normal to&nbsp;feel different kinds of&nbsp;emotions, but they need to&nbsp;respond to&nbsp;them in&nbsp;an&nbsp;acceptable manner. Show to&nbsp;your child your love and come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;plan for how you’ll deal with similar emotions in&nbsp;the future.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>You go&nbsp;shopping with your child and, at&nbsp;some point, they get frustrated or&nbsp;irritated for no&nbsp;obvious reason. It’s better to&nbsp;walk away from the place and find out what triggered the behavior. The child might be&nbsp;hungry, tired, or&nbsp;just bored but didn’t express their feelings in&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2>4. Don’t forget that you’re an&nbsp;adult and don’t indulge in&nbsp;childish behavior.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9fa/083/7a1b2b58218352c3425a8e5ed3.jpg><p>When you talk to&nbsp;your child, concentrate on&nbsp;staying an&nbsp;adult. If&nbsp;parents feel irritated or&nbsp;desperate, this means that they are no&nbsp;longer in&nbsp;the adult position or&nbsp;they don’t have the situation under control. Problems with the child’s behavior can “wake&nbsp;up” our <a href=#>inner child</a> and we&nbsp;start to&nbsp;feel helpless. It&nbsp;makes&nbsp;us make bad decisions and acts inappropriately in&nbsp;a&nbsp;difficult situation.</p><p><strong>How this works: </strong>If&nbsp;you feel like you start screaming or&nbsp;can’t control yourself in&nbsp;response to&nbsp;the child’s behavior, it’s better to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break. Leave your child for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;minutes (if&nbsp;it’s possible), take a&nbsp;deep breath, and ask yourself whether you’re acting like an&nbsp;adult now. Try to&nbsp;sort out your emotions, cool down, and get back to&nbsp;the conversation.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: Your child begs for more sweets, but you know that if&nbsp;they eat too much they’ll become too agitated and will suffer from mood swings. So&nbsp;a&nbsp;parent in&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult position would say: “I’m sorry but&nbsp;I can’t let you eat any more sweets. One piece of&nbsp;cake is&nbsp;enough for the day. Otherwise, you’ll become moody and we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;nice evening together playing board games, right?”</p><p><h2>5. Choose the punishment that corresponds to&nbsp;the child’s age.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a84/8e5/05be765795aa3361a4d2cf0ac2.jpg><p>Many parents want their children to&nbsp;act like grown-ups as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible. However, you need to&nbsp;explain things to&nbsp;children on&nbsp;their level in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make them listen and understand. It’s essential to&nbsp;find the approach that works for the children of&nbsp;your <a href=#>child’s age</a> and modify it&nbsp;as&nbsp;they grow&nbsp;up.</p><p><strong>How this works: </strong>Keep in&nbsp;mind that your child doesn’t have the experience and the knowledge that you&nbsp;do, so&nbsp;sometimes it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;challenging for them to&nbsp;make logical connections and come to&nbsp;the right conclusions. So&nbsp;the punishment should match the child’s age and their level of&nbsp;development. Overwise, the child won’t understand what they are being punished for.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> There’s no&nbsp;use in&nbsp;having an&nbsp;hour-long conversation with a&nbsp;toddler about their emotions and the consequences of&nbsp;their behavior. Children at&nbsp;this age just can’t concentrate for such a&nbsp;long time on&nbsp;one topic.</p><p><h2>6. Don’t threaten or&nbsp;scare your child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/27b/8b8/d6318357f98b26c566ec685da5.jpg><p>Don’t threaten your child or&nbsp;use corporal punishment. This can <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>negatively influence</a> a&nbsp;child’s development and cause psychological problems in&nbsp;the future. Besides, such behavior damages the emotional connection between the parents and the child and undermines parental authority.</p><p><strong>How this works: </strong>The use of&nbsp;corporal punishment may have an&nbsp;immediate effect on&nbsp;the child’s behavior, but in&nbsp;the long run, it&nbsp;won’t teach your child how to&nbsp;behave properly. You need to&nbsp;teach your child how to&nbsp;deal with their emotions and show that aggression is&nbsp;unacceptable in&nbsp;any form and definitely can’t be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;resolve conflict.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Your child went to&nbsp;the party without your permission, so&nbsp;you’re going to&nbsp;ground them for 3&nbsp;months. Instead of&nbsp;applying such harsh measures that will only turn them against you, talk about how much you love them and explain why this behavior is&nbsp;unacceptable. It&nbsp;doesn’t mean that your child can get away with everything, but the severity of&nbsp;the punishment shouldn’t exceed its seriousness.</p><p><h2>7. Let your child feel like their opinion matters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e9/fdd/4587165ee39a091d17bd4a672a.jpg><p>Remember, that no&nbsp;matter how small your child&nbsp;is, they are separate individuals with their own needs, desires, and character. Sometimes children feel too much pressure to&nbsp;act a&nbsp;certain way or&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;“perfect,” so&nbsp;they may start acting out to&nbsp;show their independence.</p><p><strong>How this works: </strong>If&nbsp;you feel like sometimes you can’t come to&nbsp;an&nbsp;agreement about the simplest matters, it’s time to&nbsp;evaluate your child’s contribution to&nbsp;<a href=#>the decision-making process</a> in&nbsp;your family. You don’t have to&nbsp;consider your toddler’s financial advice, but it’d be&nbsp;beneficial if&nbsp;you appreciated their opinion and don’t use the phrase “You can have your own opinion when you’re old enough.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Your child has a&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;TV show that they never miss, but you were invited to&nbsp;a&nbsp;party together. Your child refuses to&nbsp;go&nbsp;and insists on&nbsp;staying home and watching TV. Instead of&nbsp;diminishing their needs and saying things like “Missing one series won’t matter. You’re going with&nbsp;us.”, find a&nbsp;compromise that meets the needs of&nbsp;every member of&nbsp;your family.</p><p><h2>8. Be&nbsp;consistent with your demands and patterns of&nbsp;behavior.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/956/ba8/b1c08f57bc93de4a61deb7e24f.jpg><p>Parents should have a&nbsp;stable approach and views on&nbsp;what’s right and what’s wrong. The child should know the rules and understand which actions are unacceptable regardless of&nbsp;the circumstances. Parents should keep their words and be&nbsp;<a href=#>role models</a> for their children.</p><p><strong>How this works:</strong> It’s important that the way parents react to&nbsp;the child’s bad behavior doesn’t change depending on&nbsp;different factors. The child should know that they’ll be&nbsp;punished for their unacceptable behavior and it&nbsp;won’t depend on&nbsp;their parent’s mood. Parents should always stick to&nbsp;their promises and not let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;situation just because they don’t feel like dealing with it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the moment.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>The child watches&nbsp;TV for too long so&nbsp;the parent asks them to&nbsp;turn it&nbsp;off, but the child refuses. If&nbsp;the parent is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good mood at&nbsp;this moment, they’re likely to&nbsp;let the child continue watching. If&nbsp;they’re in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bad mood, they can tell the child off and punish them somehow. This way the child won’t understand how they should behave because the parental reaction is&nbsp;always different.</p><p><h2>9. Show your child that you’re the boss.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/041/fd6/527b0352d1a5912cee2941478f.jpg><p>While your children should feel like they can turn to&nbsp;you for support whenever they need&nbsp;to, they should also understand that you’re <a href=#>more than their friend</a>. You’re their parent, who has to&nbsp;make harsh decisions sometimes to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the health and the well-being of&nbsp;your child.</p><p><strong>How this works:</strong> Your child should feel your authority and understand that your opinion outweighs theirs. But don’t act like a&nbsp;bad boss: screaming at&nbsp;your kid and trying to&nbsp;persuade them that you’re in&nbsp;charge just because you’re a&nbsp;parent won’t do&nbsp;the trick. Children have to&nbsp;feel your confidence and see you as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person they can look up&nbsp;to, so&nbsp;they’ll listen to&nbsp;you and won’t think they can get away with bad behavior.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Your child throws a&nbsp;tantrum and refuses to&nbsp;leave the shop until you buy them a&nbsp;toy. Instead of&nbsp;screaming at&nbsp;them or&nbsp;playing into this manipulation, keep calm and act like you have the situation under control. Let the child express their emotions and then have a&nbsp;talk. Let the child feel that you can say “no” to&nbsp;their demands if&nbsp;they feel unreasonable and your word will be&nbsp;final.</p><p><h2>10. Teach your child how to&nbsp;appreciate the good things in&nbsp;their life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db7/385/1da3c1560596e3bf5f583f4d65.jpg><p>We&nbsp;want to&nbsp;give our children as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;we&nbsp;possibly can, but sometimes parents notice that children just don’t appreciate the things they have and always ask for more. Overconsumption and lack of&nbsp;appreciation can be&nbsp;serious problems that influence a&nbsp;child’s behavior. It’s essential to&nbsp;teach the child how to&nbsp;<a href=#>practice gratitude</a> from an&nbsp;early age.</p><p><strong>How this works:</strong> The gratitude technique depends on&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;the child. With toddlers, it’s better to&nbsp;start with teaching them good manners, like saying “thank you” and “please.” Parents also can try to&nbsp;switch the child’s attention from owning more things to&nbsp;getting more experiences and positive emotions. It’s essential to&nbsp;explain the value of&nbsp;money and why we&nbsp;prioritize some things over others.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> Instead of&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;presents during the holidays, try to&nbsp;create happy memories for your children that aren’t connected to&nbsp;gifts. Skating, playing board games, or&nbsp;inviting friends over doesn’t encourage your child to&nbsp;consume more and shows them that they can be&nbsp;happy without spending money.</p><p>Have you tried any of&nbsp;these techniques to&nbsp;deal with your child when they’re acting out? Or&nbsp;do&nbsp;you know any other approach that can help?
