Each day, as part of their program at École des Hautes Etudes Commerciales de Paris, they’d meet with potential prospects and, between espressos and glasses of Chianti, try to convince them that they should save the trimmings that would otherwise be tossed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Their&nbsp;efforts reaped dividends five month later. Retracing their steps, the men collected nearly a ton&nbsp;of animal hair. The commercial spinners in Italy&nbsp;that they brought it to told them it was better than fine cashmere.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But it&nbsp;wasn’t the hair of sheep or goats or alpaca. It wasn’t&nbsp;even vicuña,&nbsp;one of the finest, most expensive&nbsp;wools in the world&nbsp;used by top fashion houses like Zegna, which weaves it into expensive sweaters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Chiengora—the art of turning dog hair into textiles—has lived in relative obscurity for decades, coveted by hobbyists and fanatics. But efforts are underway to turn the unlikely fiber into a hyper-sustainable fabric.&nbsp;The term is a portmanteau of&nbsp;chien,&nbsp;French for dog, and “gora,”&nbsp;borrowed from the angora breed of rabbits and goats whose hair is used to make fabrics.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In Germany alone we have each year 1,600 tons of dog fibers that are just thrown out,” says Ann Cathrin Schönrock, a pioneering chiengora entrepreneur. “Why are we throwing these high quality fibers away instead of using it as a sustainable alternative yarn?”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The idea of turning&nbsp;dog hair into comfortable clothes&nbsp;dates back millennia. The first animals to be domesticated by humans, canines also became the first creatures willing to sit long enough for their hair to be harvested in the way sheep and goats are for wool and cashmere today. The breeding of small dogs for their hair was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a&nbsp;cornerstone of trade among the Salish peoples</a>&nbsp;of North America.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the use of dog hair declined as sheep and mass-produced textiles became more common. For North American weavers, that was&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">around the 19th century</a>&nbsp;as&nbsp;European explorers and traders introduced cheaper alternatives.&nbsp;Colonies producing cotton and wool for textile mills around the world made the chiengora&nbsp;process far more expensive, compared with its peers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today, however, the fashion industry has become a major consumer of key resources and a contributor to&nbsp;pollution.&nbsp;Popular fabrics such as cotton typically&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">require huge amounts of water to grow</a>, and the environmental impact of materials such as wool and leather has come under criticism for taking up land and&nbsp;producing methane, which adds to global warming.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s led to investments&nbsp;in the hunt for alternative materials. General Motors Co.-backed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MycoWorks</a>, which turns&nbsp;mushrooms into imitation leather, is said to have raised $187 million, while&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Meadow</a>&nbsp;is trying make fake leather via vat-grown collagen.&nbsp;Even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">textiles made of algae</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;attracting research attention.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the answer could already be sitting in a growing number of households. A recent survey from the American Veterinary Medical Association <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">found that nearly half of American households</a> had a dog, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">compared with 38%</a> in 2012.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The logic&nbsp;is simple.&nbsp;Many breeds of dog shed twice a year, and their owners take them to groomers for a trim anyway.&nbsp;Why toss the trimmings when they can be so valuable?</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">A superior breed</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The potential superiority of dog hair has long been known to a select number of material scientists. A&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">paper from North Carolina State University</a>&nbsp;20 years ago helped pave the way by&nbsp;evaluating&nbsp;18 different breeds, concluding even then&nbsp;that “chiengora may prove to be a profitable and useful fiber.” Others from academics led by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Audrone Ragaisiene</a>&nbsp;at Kaunas University of Technology in Lithuania&nbsp;found that dog hair was so warm, it could be used in socks to brave the coldest winters and help patients with rheumatic diseases.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Surjit Ramamoorthy, an assistant professor at PSG College of Technology in India, spent long hours procrastinating by grooming Shuffney, his beloved Indian Spitz, his mother suggested he may as well make it his next research topic. Intrigued, he began research and has since written several papers analyzing strands and weaves of dog hair down to a microscopic level in an effort to find the perfect blend of properties.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Depending on the breed, dog hair can be hardier than camel hair—one of the toughest commonly farmed animal fibers—and better than wool in almost every way. One commercial spinner who worked with Schönrock says some of the material provided was so fine it could be compared to vicuña.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the best breeds that Surjit has worked with is Lhasa apso—so much so that he wrote an entire paper focused on the breed. The dogs are short, but their hair is long, with better insulation. “If someone can make this commercial, it would be so good, because there’s a lot of scope for using dog hair,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lhasa-apso.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Golden retrievers, on the other hand, may be popular as pets, but they&nbsp;produce hair with less wax and stronger fibers and, Surjit says,&nbsp;their coats are shorter than you might expect, resulting in less usable material.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The American Kennel Club suggests that dogs with long undercoats, such as the Chow Chow and Bernese Mountain Dog, work best. Each strand should be at least an inch and a half long.&nbsp;Samoyeds&nbsp;are&nbsp;especially prized by hobbyists for their soft&nbsp;white coats.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the craft website Etsy, searches for “chiengora” turn up hundreds of results. They run the gamut from spinners who turn bags of your pet’s hair into yarn to knitters hawking socks and beanies made from the material.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There, handspun Samoyed yarn can set you back $420 a kilogram—more than double the price of fine cashmere, which is prized by luxury textile mills like Loro Piana. That’s still below the&nbsp;€600 ($636) per kilogram cited by the 2022 edition of industry textbook&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fibers</a>&nbsp;as the “typical price” of chiengora.&nbsp;A kilogram of cashmere, by comparison, runs&nbsp;€40 to €120.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The dual barriers</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Despite the clear benefits of weaving dog hair into textiles, the material has&nbsp;yet to take off commercially.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The main issue is twofold. One is cultural: When the idea comes up in conversation, many think of Cruella de Vil, the fictional villain of&nbsp;One Hundred and One Dalmatians&nbsp;who covets the eponymous pets for their spotty fur. But proponents say most people quickly get past their inhibitions once they understand that the process is&nbsp;harmless.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rachel Casey, a veterinarian and director of the UK adoption agency&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogs Trust</a>, said she could understand its appeal. Over the past few decades, dogs have shifted from being guards and ornaments to members of the family, a trend intensified by the pandemic. Owners are looking for ways to feel even closer to their pets.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s probably the increasing number of dogs, but also the changing role of dogs in people’s lives, that have led to the increase” in interest in chiengora,&nbsp;Casey&nbsp;says.&nbsp;“From a dog health point of view, combing is actually a good thing to do, so it’s clearly something that could be a really sustainable way of creating yarn.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The bigger issue, though, is gathering it at scale. Where other fibers have generations of harvesters collecting hairs in exactly the right way, getting commercial quantities of chiengora would require teaching households and groomers exactly how to correctly comb their pets, in the same way cashmere goats are today.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A dog’s outer coat is typically too tough;&nbsp;hair on the foot can be too short. The cleaner and softer undercoat around the chest, however, is&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an ideal source</a>. Once the hair is combed, it’s sorted through a process called carding to align the strands so it can be processed into yarn and eventually weaved.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An easier&nbsp;alternative to combing would be using clipped hair from grooming salons—but there&nbsp;the problem is consistency. You don’t want to mix the silken threads of a Lhasa Apso with the notoriously matted curls of a poodle, all at wildly different lengths.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Over the next two years, Surjit aims to use industrial techniques to soften the hair from such suppliers. That could involve using chemicals to wash the hairs and reduce their spikiness—regardless of which coat they come from—so that they’re soft to the touch.&nbsp;He says he’s&nbsp;already solved some of the other issues by blending dog hair with synthetic materials: A&nbsp;mix of 75% Lhasa Apso and 25% polyester is an ideal cocktail of insulation and comfort. But even this approach depends on the kindness of strangers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There is enough material out there, but it’s not like sheep rearing, where you’ll find hundreds together,” Surjit says. His constant hunt for more Lhasa apso hair has turned every car ride into a scouting expedition.&nbsp;“Near my area, whenever I see one I stop my vehicle, go to the owners’ home and negotiate to cut their hair.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After working with dog hair gathered from Italian groomers,&nbsp;Bollettini and Apuzzo&nbsp;got their&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiengora Project</a>&nbsp;into&nbsp;the prestigious incubator Station F.&nbsp;Later that year, they merged with Schönrock’s company, Yarnsustain Schönrock Uhl,&nbsp;in 2021. While it reaped sales and publicity (and&nbsp;even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared on the German version of&nbsp;Shark Tank</a>), it suffered from an inability to scale.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It shuttered in April 2023, and Bollettini and Apuzzo parted ways, but Schönrock continues to try to find&nbsp;a way forward.&nbsp;Pre-sales of her&nbsp;book&nbsp;that details the best breeds and methods of gathering their hair will start from November.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Unlike Surjit, Schönrock remains&nbsp;wary of introducing synthetic materials into the mix. She believes that more research and education will reap the Holy Grail—pure, consistent chiengora harvested ethically and sustainably from the near-billion dogs living around the world today.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m so deeply convinced this will be a legacy I can leave,” she says. She hopes her upcoming book will educate dog owners and supercharge the ethical gathering of hair at scale. “As soon as we achieve that and scale the sourcing,” she says,&nbsp;“we will have an unbelievably high-quality yarn.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2NlgHZ9jp2moGWYlrazedKuqq2ZmaOuo7jEZquesKSeuaZ5xZqZq6GTZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-get-jason-momoas-flowing-aquaman-locks-even-if-you-have-short-hair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to get Jason Momoa's flowing Aquaman locks  even if you have short hair">&larr;
