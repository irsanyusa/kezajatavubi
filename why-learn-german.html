So if you’re interested in learning a new one, what makes German a good choice? Why <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learn German</a> instead of Spanish, Italian, or French, for example?&nbsp;<br>A really good way to figure out if a language is right for you is to consider all the benefits of learning that particular language – and German offers several solid advantages. From its similarity to English to increased opportunities in the business world, there are a lot of reasons why you should learn German as a foreign language.</p><p>1. <a href=#>It’s relatively easy to learn</a>&nbsp;<br>2. <a href=#>It’s widely spoken</a><br>3. <a href=#>It can lead to career and business opportunities</a><br>4. <a href=#>You’ll have access to top-notch, low-cost education</a><br>5. <a href=#>German literature and films are worth checking out</a></p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-It’s-relatively-easy-to-learn>1. It’s relatively easy to learn</h2><p>If you’re reading this article, you obviously already know English. That’s a huge advantage when it comes to learning German. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The two languages are probably more similar</a> than you realize. They both come from the same (Germanic) language family, so they have a lot in common. They use the same alphabet and numbering system, and they share many word sounds, for instance.&nbsp;</p><p>Another reason that German is quite easy to learn is that it’s quite a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">phonetic language</a> with pretty structured spelling rules. Once you’ve learned the alphabet, word pronunciation is relatively straightforward (dare we say, much easier than in English).&nbsp;</p><p>And, finally, German only has one form of present tense. Compared to the four present tenses in English, that sounds like a piece of cake!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-It’s-widely-spoken>2. It’s widely spoken</h2><p>German<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> is spoken in many parts of Europe:</a> There are six countries where it’s an official language, and 10 more where it’s a minority language. This makes it the most widely spoken language in Europe after English. As for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">number of German speakers</a> worldwide, there are about 100 million native speakers around the globe, and approximately 130 million more who speak it as a second or foreign language. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it’s one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">20 most widely spoken languages</a> in the world.</p><p>Knowing a language that so many other people speak is very useful. First, the world of business, education, film, and literature will become much wider for you (more on that below). On top of that, learning German means you’ll have more opportunities for social connections, you’ll be able to get around various places more easily when you travel, you’ll have access to more websites (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 17 million</a>) – and the list goes on.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-It-can-lead-to-career-and-business-opportunities>3. It can lead to career and business opportunities</h2><p>Germany has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the largest economy in Europe</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the fourth-largest in the world</a>. That means that knowing German can be a huge advantage if you’re looking to advance your career or grow your business.&nbsp;</p><p>Becoming fluent in German will open the door to a variety of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in-demand careers</a>, including software development, mechanical engineering, IT consulting, and product management.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you’re looking to expand your existing business (especially online), it would be smart to set your sights on Germany. Just consider <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">these e-commerce figures</a>: Currently, around 77% of German consumers are e-commerce users; that number is expected to reach 81.9% in 2025. And each of those e-commerce consumers is expected to spend a yearly average of $1,724 online. In other words, there’s money to be made in the German market.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-You’ll-have-access-to-top-notch,-low-cost-education>4. You’ll have access to top-notch, low-cost education</h2><p>If you don’t know anything about the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">school system</a> in Germany, one thing worth noting is that it has some very <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">highly rated universities</a>. Knowing fluent German means you’ll be eligible for a high-quality post-secondary education.</p><p>But there’s more!</p><p>The tuition at most German universities is either free or very cheap (think €500 per term). And yes, that includes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">international students</a>. The only catch is that you have to prove your fluency in German. How cool is that?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-German-literature-and-films-are-worth-checking-out>5. German literature and films are worth checking out</h2><p>If you’ve ever tried to read a translated book or watch a movie with subtitles, you probably know that it often feels like something is missing. The only way to understand a story’s true meaning is to watch or read it in its intended language.&nbsp;</p><p>Germany has given the world some incredible films and literature, both classic and modern. From the books of Franz Kafka and Thomas Mann to the films of Fritz Lang (Metropolis) and Werner Herzog (Mein liebster Feind), learning German will open the door to a whole new world of fantastic media for you to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>So is it worth it to learn German?</h2><p>We’ve gone through some great reasons to learn the German language, including having more career and educational prospects and enjoying some world-renowned entertainment. Hopefully, you’ve seen that it’s definitely worth it to learn German –&nbsp; no matter what you want to do with it.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Andrea-1.jpg><h2>Andrea Byaruhanga</h2><p>Andrea is a Canadian freelance writer and editor specializing in English, e-learning, EdTech, and SaaS.
