She said that she simply doesn’t know how to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;terms with the fact that her husband turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;very mean person. The woman told&nbsp;us that he&nbsp;was constantly making comments about her body odor, and she even started having some problems with her mental state because of&nbsp;it. But the revelation that she made further, made her just mad, and we&nbsp;feel for her, having found out the details of&nbsp;her husband’s intrigue.</p><p><h2>The woman’s relationship with her husband has always been amazing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e47/05c/5fa9df5d2e83b9ff7069f47d1f.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Lilly, wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;us, and she sounded very desperate about the situation that she encountered in&nbsp;her happy family. Lilly said that her husband, George, and she have been happily married for over a&nbsp;decade, and she has never witnessed any signs of&nbsp;disrespectful behavior from George.</p><p>Lilly revealed, «In&nbsp;fact, our marriage has always been something that has been grounded on&nbsp;deep feelings, huge passion towards each other, mutual respect and trust. I&nbsp;have always believed that my&nbsp;union with George is&nbsp;happy, it&nbsp;was ideal for&nbsp;me, and he’s always been a&nbsp;loving and caring husband.»</p><p>There was one thing that made it&nbsp;all less bright, and it&nbsp;was all about the classic thing, a&nbsp;relationship between Lilly and her MIL. The woman wrote, «I&nbsp;have always been in&nbsp;tough terms with my&nbsp;MIL, because&nbsp;I just didn’t like her personality. She’s always been a&nbsp;very authoritative and entitled person, she sincerely believed that it’s only her opinion that counts, in&nbsp;absolutely every matter. And she adores to&nbsp;interfere with other people’s private lives.<br>This way or&nbsp;that, I&nbsp;did try to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;terms with her and just acted politely all the way, and it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;big deal for&nbsp;me, because we&nbsp;didn’t see each other very often. George and&nbsp;I live in&nbsp;another country and the chances that she would be&nbsp;interfering with our life, were relatively small. So, I&nbsp;just accepted the fact that my&nbsp;MIL will never become my&nbsp;second mother.»</p><p><h2>Lilly’s husband started behaving in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very disrespectful way, all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b20/22e/ae194a5be586853caadf661d13.jpg><p>Lilly goes on&nbsp;with her letter, saying, that around a&nbsp;year ago, her husband’s behavior has totally changed. The woman explained, «George started making rude comments about my&nbsp;body odor. And there was no&nbsp;visible reason for&nbsp;it, no&nbsp;change in&nbsp;my&nbsp;health or&nbsp;lifestyle, everything had been normal, up&nbsp;until one day, and ever since George started doing&nbsp;it. Every single day, at&nbsp;least once, he&nbsp;would tell me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I stink and smell of&nbsp;body odor.»</p><p>Lilly tracked back to&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;their relationship, saying, that when they met she showered every day, used a&nbsp;deodorant in&nbsp;the morning, brushed her teeth 3&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day. And nothing has changed ever since in&nbsp;her hygiene. But George would make these nasty comments again and again.</p><p>Lilly confessed, «I&nbsp;became so&nbsp;paranoid about my&nbsp;body smelling bad that&nbsp;I started to&nbsp;shower 3&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day, I&nbsp;applied a&nbsp;special strong deodorant every hour (I&nbsp;even had a&nbsp;reminder on&nbsp;my&nbsp;phone). I&nbsp;used a&nbsp;perfume, and&nbsp;I brushed my&nbsp;teeth 5&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day, it&nbsp;was anytime&nbsp;I ate or&nbsp;drank something that wasn’t water.»</p><p><h2>George’s comments took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;Lilly’s mental state.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/591/b8d/2ee47457f2bbe1f2ca5f3d1974.jpg><p>For every person, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;very unpleasant to&nbsp;hear that their body stinks. And if&nbsp;it’s said by&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant one, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very rude manner, and on&nbsp;a&nbsp;daily basis, this could be&nbsp;even worse. The same was for Lilly, and she admitted that she was very upset because of&nbsp;such behavior.</p><p>The woman wrote, «I&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I was going crazy. I&nbsp;was sure&nbsp;I didn’t smell bad all the time of&nbsp;our relationship. And I&nbsp;didn’t think&nbsp;I smelled bad at&nbsp;that period of&nbsp;time, but it&nbsp;was obvious that&nbsp;I did smell bad to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband. I’ve always been this type of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who would sneakily smell their own armpits. I&nbsp;visited a&nbsp;doctor, and he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;there was nothing medically wrong.<br>The whole thing was getting to&nbsp;the point where&nbsp;I literally started asking my&nbsp;friends and family members to&nbsp;smell my&nbsp;armpits and to&nbsp;tell me&nbsp;honestly if&nbsp;I smelled bad. They all said&nbsp;I didn’t smell like body odor at&nbsp;all, one family member even said&nbsp;I smelled too clean like a&nbsp;lush store.»</p><p><h2>One day, Lilly discovered the reason why she was smelling bad for her husband.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7e/655/625c30513a9af7edbaeb95e0c1.jpg><p>One day, Lilly unexpectedly uncovered the truth behind her husband’s suspicious behavior. By&nbsp;that moment, the woman was totally paranoid, and she wouldn’t even cuddle or&nbsp;kiss when George said that she smelled bad.</p><p>One morning, Lilly went outside for a&nbsp;walk, and George stayed at&nbsp;home. Lilly said, «I&nbsp;went away and told George that I’d be&nbsp;back in&nbsp;around 3&nbsp;hours. I&nbsp;was thinking of&nbsp;visiting my&nbsp;sister and decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;foot and to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;gulp of&nbsp;fresh air, when&nbsp;I suddenly felt bad. I&nbsp;thought I’d better come back home and lay down instead of&nbsp;walking, and&nbsp;I returned back home in&nbsp;approximately 30&nbsp;minutes after I&nbsp;left. Of&nbsp;course, George wasn’t expecting me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;back.»</p><p>Lilly goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «Just because&nbsp;I felt bad, I&nbsp;entered the house silently, trying to&nbsp;not make any extra noise with my&nbsp;keys, etc. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;terrible headache and every sound resonated in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head with a&nbsp;growing pain. George didn’t hear me&nbsp;coming&nbsp;in, he&nbsp;was on&nbsp;a&nbsp;video call with his mother.» Lilly said that George and her MIL were speaking very loudly, and it&nbsp;seemed they were having some argument. The woman was irritated by&nbsp;the loud noises from George’s room, and she wanted to&nbsp;come in&nbsp;and ask him to&nbsp;put his headphones on&nbsp;while talking to&nbsp;his mother. Then, she suddenly realized they both were talking about her.</p><p>Lilly wrote, «George was nervously saying to&nbsp;MIL that he’s fed up&nbsp;with this „smelly game“. He&nbsp;sounded pretty much stressed, and he&nbsp;was saying that because of&nbsp;his remarks about my&nbsp;body odor, we&nbsp;stopped getting intimate at&nbsp;all and that&nbsp;I wouldn’t even kiss him anymore. His mother, in&nbsp;her turn, was saying that he&nbsp;should be&nbsp;patient if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;keep me&nbsp;beside him. Turned out, George’s father always said such things to&nbsp;her, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;sure fire technique to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;woman never leave you. The woman was supposed to&nbsp;stay with one man forever, because „she will feel too low to&nbsp;cheat, will be&nbsp;devoted only to&nbsp;you, and will always be&nbsp;fresh and clean.“»</p><p>So, basically, Lilly’s MIL was teaching her son on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;keep Lilly beside him, and she told him about the nasty method that his own father used on&nbsp;her once! Lilly admitted that this was disgusting, and she was mad at&nbsp;the fact that George would ever try this vile technique on&nbsp;her. The woman concluded, «George doesn’t know yet that I’m aware of&nbsp;everything. I&nbsp;want a&nbsp;divorce, but&nbsp;I want a&nbsp;revenge before&nbsp;I split up&nbsp;with him. I&nbsp;know that for many people George’s actions would not be&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious reason for divorce, but&nbsp;I just can’t imagine living the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life with a&nbsp;person, who applies the „smelly methods“ on&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, who loves him with all her heart.»</p><p>And here’s yet another woman, who made a&nbsp;shocking revelation about her husband after she found a&nbsp;tampon in&nbsp;his car. <a href=#>Read more</a> to&nbsp;find out how she switched into a&nbsp;«true detective» mode and found out the truth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6rLHPrWStnZyhtq%2BzjKacZqyYlsFuudhmmaicqWLAtbXNpKpmoV2fwrTAjJ%2BmrqaUYry2wIywn7JlmJp6pbXDZqCtZZGjsW61zGapmp%2BZo7RuhJBxa2twXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./14-celebrities-who-celebrated-their-kids-with-lovely-tattoos-812085.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="14 Celebrities Who Celebrated Their Kids With Lovely Tattoos">&larr;
