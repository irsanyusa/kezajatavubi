Those are the magical designs that we&nbsp;present in&nbsp;this collection, garments from feature films that have not only not gone unnoticed, but that were a&nbsp;vital part of&nbsp;the story as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were another character.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>brings you a&nbsp;selection of&nbsp;movie dresses that are so&nbsp;majestic, they are worthy of&nbsp;queens and princesses.</p><p><h2>1. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66b/389/ccfe8d57b4a754c677fd7f5e12.jpg><p>This <a href=#>fabulous dress</a>, designed by&nbsp;William Travilla, is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous movie costumes in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;Hollywood movies and it&nbsp;was the perfect attire for someone like <a href=# title="Marilyn Monroe" data-link=tag>Marilyn Monroe</a>. The pink satin, strapless, floor-length design features a&nbsp;daring slit and a&nbsp;large bow right at&nbsp;the lower back.</p><p>Even though this particular dress is&nbsp;beautiful, this was not the one Marilyn had originally intended to&nbsp;<a href=#>wear</a> when the song “Diamonds Are a&nbsp;Girl’s Best Friend” played in&nbsp;the movie. There was another design that had been conceived for this scene, but since it&nbsp;was not approved by&nbsp;the studio, Travilla had to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;work right away to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;backup dress. He&nbsp;was such a&nbsp;talented designer that he&nbsp;finished this masterpiece just 2&nbsp;days before the song recordings began. It&nbsp;was later auctioned, set at&nbsp;$150,000 to&nbsp;$250,000, although its final bid is&nbsp;suspected to&nbsp;have been much higher.</p><p><h2>2. Titanic (1997)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e8/f8c/1ff45c5597ab6ede659a8973ed.jpg><p>This wonderful dress, made by&nbsp;designer Deborah Lynn Scott, was quite a&nbsp;<a href=#>challenge</a> in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;technical requirements. In&nbsp;fact, 24&nbsp;copies had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;created using different fabrics. This was so&nbsp;that the final dress would look flawless both when wet and when it&nbsp;was dry, since you probably remember this is&nbsp;the dress that <a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a> is&nbsp;wearing in&nbsp;most of&nbsp;the scenes where the <a href=# title=Titanic data-link=tag>Titanic</a> is&nbsp;sinking.</p><p>Finally, the so-called “sinking dress” ended up&nbsp;being made with chiffon in&nbsp;shades of&nbsp;cherry and black and was adorned with rhinestones. Much like the design of&nbsp;the previous item in&nbsp;our compilation, Kate Winslet’s dress reached a&nbsp;final auction price of&nbsp;over <a href=#>$300,000</a>, and this hardly comes as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise because it’s so&nbsp;beautiful.</p><p><h2>3. The Princess Diaries&nbsp;2: Royal Engagement (2004)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c5/d7b/cad1305e43990d53e42634e793.jpg><p>You probably remember that sumptuous scene where Princess Amelia of&nbsp;Genovia was crowned in&nbsp;the sequel to&nbsp;<i>The Princess Diaries</i>. There you could hardly miss the stunning dress that actress <a href=# title="Anne Hathaway" data-link=tag>Anne Hathaway</a> was wearing. Long, in&nbsp;light tones, with decorative gold embroidery, and adorned with 2&nbsp;bows on&nbsp;the shoulders. These bows, in&nbsp;turn, hold a&nbsp;long cape that is&nbsp;several meters long that she dragged on&nbsp;the floor, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;train, to&nbsp;make her look like true royalty.</p><p>But if&nbsp;you thought that the dress was fabulous, wait until you hear the following fun fact. All the accessories that Hathaway is&nbsp;wearing probably caught your eye as&nbsp;well. That’s not surprising since the jewelry worn by&nbsp;both the princess and the queen was actually <a href=#>authentic jewelry</a>.</p><p><h2>4. Mirror, Mirror (2012)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01c/d60/5844c1501fba116a2a4a31d7f9.jpg><p>Another actress who became known for stepping into the shoes of&nbsp;a&nbsp;princess and, incidentally, for wearing some amazing and colorful dresses that captivated the audience, was Lilly Collins. This popular British actress played Snow White in&nbsp;the movie <i>Mirror, Mirror</i>.</p><p>The particular dress that you can see above, in&nbsp;our compilation, was <a href=#>designed</a> by&nbsp;Eiko Ishioka. It&nbsp;actually has a&nbsp;real corset and a&nbsp;wire frame underneath the floral print skirt. The wire frame was added to&nbsp;give the dress enough lift because they wanted something impressive. Thanks to&nbsp;this it&nbsp;was about 5&nbsp;feet in&nbsp;circumference. The embroidery work, puffed sleeves, skirt, and bodice made the dress a&nbsp;work of&nbsp;art that required about 25-35 yards (or&nbsp;around 22-32&nbsp;meters) of&nbsp;fabric to&nbsp;be&nbsp;finished.</p><p><h2>5. Beauty and the Beast (2017)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bea/1a3/f10a0f50b39fa3750b18693123.jpg><p>There’s no&nbsp;way on&nbsp;Earth that you can think of&nbsp;Belle, and not see her wearing that floaty yellow dress. It’s like it&nbsp;fits her so&nbsp;well that you can’t not automatically think of&nbsp;it&nbsp;after saying her name. So&nbsp;when, in&nbsp;the latest live-action adaptation of&nbsp;the story, we&nbsp;saw the famous princess played by&nbsp;Emma Watson wearing another version, we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;say that the producer’s decision was kind of&nbsp;edgy. The dress she appears with is&nbsp;less flashy and conveys a&nbsp;much more modern and fresh look that suits Watson so&nbsp;well, nobody could complain.</p><p>It&nbsp;will forever be&nbsp;remembered as&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic white dress <a href=#>decorated</a> with painted flowers, both on&nbsp;the bodice and on&nbsp;the skirt, and also with some imitation flowers on&nbsp;the fabric in&nbsp;the same tone added here and there, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;elegant fashion. The sophisticated sleeves of&nbsp;the dress, almost transparent, are also covered with flowers. Every detail adds something and is&nbsp;in&nbsp;perfect harmony with the character it&nbsp;represents.</p><p><h2>6. Gone with the Wind (1939)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/910/001/7de3b3545494d187d23b198eac.jpg><p>Vivien Leigh wore several different gowns throughout the film. They were all made by&nbsp;the Californian costume designer Walter Plunkett, who served as&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiration for many other designers, including big names like Christian Dior. We&nbsp;can probably agree that they’re all wonderful, but the green dress above has something extra special.</p><p>You first see this gown in&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene in&nbsp;which the protagonist intends to&nbsp;dominate a&nbsp;rich man, but she has nothing to&nbsp;wear for the occasion. So&nbsp;she comes up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;fairly strange idea: to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;dress out of&nbsp;the green velvet curtains hanging in&nbsp;the windows of&nbsp;her estate. Plunkett was a&nbsp;great tailor, prudent and detail-oriented. The proof of&nbsp;that is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;<a href=#>managed</a> to&nbsp;make this design look as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;were sewn by&nbsp;an&nbsp;amateur. While beautiful, the dress was far from being perfect. If&nbsp;you look closely you can see and even feel how it&nbsp;was done in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurry. It&nbsp;was actually left in&nbsp;the sun for a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;to&nbsp;look like worn curtains.</p><p><h2>7. Snow White and the Huntsman (2012)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ac/b3d/d0c773564aaebc761fee1f3013.jpg><p>The costumes in&nbsp;this movie are magnificent, but this particular design really caught our eye. It&nbsp;was even more so&nbsp;because it&nbsp;was <a href=# title="Charlize Theron" data-link=tag>Charlize Theron</a> who wore it&nbsp;when she was playing the role of&nbsp;the wicked witch in&nbsp;<i>Snow White and the Huntsman</i>.</p><p>This stunning garment was the work of&nbsp;Colleen Atwood, who later said during an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> that all the witch’s costumes were the most difficult to&nbsp;make. That was because they had to&nbsp;reflect how evil she was, but at&nbsp;the same time, they were meant to&nbsp;mirror the transformation she undergoes throughout the plot. Fabrics from all over the world and the most peculiar decorations, like beetle shells, were used to&nbsp;make them.</p><p><h2>8. To&nbsp;Catch a&nbsp;Thief (1955)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/076/ba1/dc0dba5824ab681d370ef9695e.jpg><p>This dress, worthy of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Greek goddess, was <a href=#>created</a> by&nbsp;designer Edith Head. It&nbsp;was made with chiffon in&nbsp;different shades of&nbsp;blue and under its shapes and delicate folds of&nbsp;fabric, it&nbsp;hides a&nbsp;corset with thin straps. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, its simplicity comes as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise, something that goes great on&nbsp;a&nbsp;classic beauty like <a href=# title="Grace Kelly" data-link=tag>Grace Kelly</a>. The actress also chose not to&nbsp;wear any accessories. She limited herself to&nbsp;adding a&nbsp;simple floating scarf and a&nbsp;blue handbag, which gives it&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural and casual touch.</p><p>A&nbsp;color that’s as&nbsp;particular and as&nbsp;bright as&nbsp;that of&nbsp;this dress was far from being <a href=#>customary</a> for evening wear back in&nbsp;the day, let alone for a&nbsp;young unmarried woman like the character was supposed to&nbsp;be. However, this piece was consciously designed with the aim of&nbsp;highlighting the actress’s beauty at&nbsp;all times and giving her character a&nbsp;cold and distant appearance, which would, later&nbsp;on, fade away as&nbsp;the plot unfolded.</p><p><h2>9. The Chronicles of&nbsp;Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/678/2a2/0986415820ae057fba736beaaa.jpg><p>Amazing gowns aren’t just a&nbsp;princess thing. Another witch that wore a&nbsp;dreamy dress is&nbsp;Jadis, the White Witch played by&nbsp;Tilda Swinton in&nbsp;<i>The Chronicles of&nbsp;Narnia </i>saga. All the designs she wears are able to&nbsp;convey perfectly how cold this character&nbsp;is, but with a&nbsp;unique mixture of&nbsp;power and mystique. They were the work of&nbsp;film costume designer Isis Mussenden, and making this dress was a&nbsp;big job because it&nbsp;is&nbsp;composed of&nbsp;3&nbsp;different layers of&nbsp;fabric.</p><p>All the different fabrics used to&nbsp;make this astonishing piece were dyed so&nbsp;that the final result would <a href=#>mimic</a> the strange color of&nbsp;ice. The first layer of&nbsp;the dress was made of&nbsp;velvet. This was meant to&nbsp;give the whole piece more structure and some rigidity. The second layer is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mix of&nbsp;felted wool and silk, mainly to&nbsp;add more texture. Finally, the last layer is&nbsp;a&nbsp;voluminous lace, which we&nbsp;can see in&nbsp;the bodice. This last layer is&nbsp;what gives that special touch of&nbsp;elegance and majesty to&nbsp;the look.</p><p><h2>10. Aladdin (2019)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ecd/722/ac5fb65a3287b0c70baf3385a2.jpg><p>Designer Michael Wilkinson <a href=#>traveled</a> through the Middle East, Africa, Turkey, and Pakistan in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;inspiration and authentic materials to&nbsp;create the costumes for the live-action adaption of&nbsp;Disney’s <a href=# title=Aladdin data-link=tag>Aladdin</a>. While most of&nbsp;the women of&nbsp;Agrabah wear attire that is&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;Arabian culture, Princess Jasmine’s outfits are actually inspired by&nbsp;the more baroque style that is&nbsp;found in&nbsp;South Asia. This was meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;tribute to&nbsp;her mother, who came from a&nbsp;neighboring kingdom called Shehrabad.</p><p>Therefore, her beautiful dress was made of&nbsp;silk, had paisley prints, and was adorned with beads and embroidery. It’s hard to&nbsp;not agree with Wilkinson’s genius and original combination of&nbsp;fuchsia and coral. These are both bright and energetic colors and they were clearly the perfect way the designer found to&nbsp;represent the princess’s thirst for adventure and zest for life.</p><p><h2>11. Ziegfeld Girl (1941)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e2/c9a/f97641553898e5da76cb10bfc7.jpg><p>This dress was created by&nbsp;Adrian Adolph Greenburg, known simply as&nbsp;<a href=#>Adrian</a>. He&nbsp;was the official costume designer for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer between 1928 and 1941. He&nbsp;was also <a href=#>responsible</a> for creating the amazing pieces you can see in&nbsp;<i>The Wizard of&nbsp;Oz</i>, including Dorothy’s unforgettable red shoes.</p><p>This magnificent fantasy dress, worn by&nbsp;Hedy Lamarr, certainly has just as&nbsp;much class and style as&nbsp;those beautiful red shoes. For starters, the dreamy decoration made of&nbsp;stars takes you to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different world just by&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;it. As&nbsp;you can see in&nbsp;the pictures, dozens of&nbsp;stars adorn the pattern of&nbsp;the fabric, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the accessories that are worn by&nbsp;the actress. And her sleeves not only reach all the way to&nbsp;the floor but they are several meters long, which creates a&nbsp;majestic starry tail.</p><p><h2>12. <i>The Princess Switch</i> (2018)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1bd/6bf/3f8bf3556cb03083651b66df4c.jpg><p>This wonderful dress with a&nbsp;romantic touch, <a href=#>designed</a> by&nbsp;Luminita Lungu, really caught our eye. It’s far from being the typical princess dress with an&nbsp;armored skirt. You know the kind we’re talking about&nbsp;— those gowns that look flashy and uncomfortable. Well, this design is&nbsp;actually pretty simple and natural but that doesn’t mean it&nbsp;doesn’t look elegant and feminine.</p><p>The layers of&nbsp;white tulle on&nbsp;the skirt give a&nbsp;certain sense of&nbsp;fullness and body to&nbsp;the piece but without adding too much weight. This is&nbsp;maybe where that light and comfortable look comes from. On&nbsp;the other hand, the embroidered flowers, along with the sweetheart neckline, ended up&nbsp;giving the whole character a&nbsp;delicate air of&nbsp;femininity, but in&nbsp;a&nbsp;subtle way.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;all of&nbsp;these dresses did you like the most? What other wonderful movie costumes do&nbsp;you remember and think should be&nbsp;added to&nbsp;this list?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zecicpqehk2Kxs7HSrJysZaSdrrV51p6pnmWjpHq4sculZKaZlJp6tbTEsmSsoJGlsqV5z6inZpulocG2vsRmnaiqXZyyr7HRmquip56oenl8kWppa2c%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-woman-gets-multiple-surgeries-to-have-the-worlds-biggest-cheeks-shares-photos-818741.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Woman Gets Multiple Surgeries to Have The Worlds Biggest Cheeks, Shares Photos">&larr;
