One, it could be a state of isolation or remoteness. Two, it may mean sadness due to lack of companionship.</p><p class=align-left>In life, it is not the lack of physical companionship that makes one lonely but the feeling of hollowness inside. Feeling empty inside can be more damaging than not having friends around to talk to.</p><p class=align-left>The reality is that everyone feels lonely at some point. If prolonged, the feeling of solitude can deteriorate your physical and mental health.</p><p class=align-left>An effective way of dealing with loneliness is expressing it. But how do you express loneliness in words? This is where feeling alone quotes come in handy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99c85b7cb88bbac6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful healing quotes to help you get through the tough times</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They help you to fend off all the sadness and worries that you harbor inside. In turn, this helps you to harness positive energy.</p><h2>Loneliness quotes that everyone can relate to</h2><p class=align-left>Given that loneliness is a part of human life, it is vital to know how to express it. Through words, you can create a positive mindset and focus on improving your social wellbeing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99c85b7cb88bbac6.jpg><p class=align-left>The good news is that there are many being alone quotes that anyone going through solitude can relate to. The quotes can be your source of encouragement and optimism when you feel like you are on your own. What is more, they allow you to conquer loneliness mentally first.</p><p class=align-left>Here are 10 quotes on loneliness to get you started:</p><ul><li>We need solitude. Because when we’re alone, we’re free from obligations, we don’t need to put on a show, and we can hear our own thoughts. - <i>Tamim Ansary</i></li><li>It does not mean that I am lonely just because I choose to stand alone. On the contrary, it shows I am strong enough to take on challenges by myself.</li><li>In life, you cannot always be strong. Sometimes you just need to be lonely, to cry out your fears and worries. At other times, it helps just to let be what you cannot change.</li><li>Lonely hours is the best time of life because it’s the only time I share my deepest secrets with the most trusted person in the world, myself.</li><li>There are two ways I deal with loneliness. One, I look at the stars. Unlike people, the stars are always there for me. Two, I close my eyes for a while and focus on the people I love. They always make me feel I am not alone.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/235ba67697918c2e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best quotes about helping others that will tug at your compassion</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6cde554da3acb8f1_w.png><ul><li>Loneliness, just like death, is part of this life. What is important is seeking the face of God. Through Christ, God conquers loneliness, death, and other human fears.</li><li>There is only one cure for loneliness, and that is love. Love is more profound than the desire for physical intimacy. It is the principal escape route for solitude.</li><li>I choose to be alone not because I am lonely but because I want to hear my voice. It allows me to distance myself from the distracting voices around me and to focus on my own.</li><li>Loneliness makes one an artist. In uttermost solitude, a musician sings with so much life while a writer passionately explains the unfathomable.</li><li>Life can be confusing. Sometimes it is just too challenging to be alone, and at other times, it feels great to be alone.</li></ul><h2>Quotes about loneliness from popular songs</h2><p class=align-left>Music is a great form of expression.

What you call loneliness, I call enjoying one's company.</li><li>I would rather be unhappy on my own than with another person.</li><li>Do not hate me for feeling better when people are not around me. It is just that they always leave when I try to let them in. I guess I am used to staying alone. After all, it is worse to have people who do not care around than having yourself.</li><li>There is nothing stranger than being a global celebrity and still feel lonely. It is even more terrible than poverty. So, I guess that richness is when you have real people around you.</li><li>Let not my smile confuse you. Sometimes the most elaborate smile harbors the deepest pain.</li><li>I do not know what hurts more than loneliness. I wish I could ignore you as you do me.</li><li>I am the guy that everyone replaces after a while. It also seems I care for people who do not feel the same.
