You can also learn by unconsciously training your brain to the <span><strong><a href=#>sounds of French.</a></strong></span> How do you do that? By watching French movies! Netflix offers this possibility, but it’s not always easy to find French movies on their catalogue. Here’s our guide to some of the best French films on Netflix.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong>Top 5 French films on Netlix</strong></h2><p><span>As you may know, the <span><strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong></span> catalogue is different from country to country and changes frequently, so you may not necessarily find all the movies mentioned.</span></p><p><span>In this selection, you’ll find films of different genres that will allow you to get to know the actors that are in vogue in France.</span></p><h3><b>1. Don’t worry, I’m fine</b><span> (</span><span>Je vais bien ne t’en fais pas)</span></h3><p><span><strong>Genre</strong>: </span><span>drama</span></p><p><strong>Synopsis</strong><span>: As she comes back from holidays, Lili, 19 years old, learns from her parents that her twin brother Loïc has left home after a violent argument with his father. Loïc doesn’t give her any news and Lili ends up persuading herself that something has happened to her and goes looking for him. What she will discover is beyond comprehension.</span></p><p><span>The film is an adaptation of the <span><strong><a href=#>book</a></strong></span> of the same name.</span></p><p><strong>Actors</strong><span>: You’ll see in this film Mélanie Laurent, who played in Inglourious Basterds one of Quentin Tarantino’s last films, or in Now you see me.</span></p><p><span>You will also see Kad Merad who is one of the best-known comedians in France, as he played the main character in the film that broke all cinema admissions records in France: </span><i><span>Bienvenue chez les Ch’tis. </span></i><span>This film is also notable for its music: the song « U-Turn (Lili) » is composed and interpreted by the band AaRON. The singer of the band makes an appearance in the film in the role of Loïc’s friend who makes Lili listen to the song.</span></p><h3><strong>2. </strong><b>Jour J</b></h3><p><span><strong>Genre</strong>: </span><span>comedy</span></p><p><strong>Synopsis</strong><span>: Mathias and Alexia have been a couple for years, and for the first time, he cheats on her with Juliette, a wedding planner… When Alexia discovers Juliette’s business card in Mathias’ pocket, he loses his senses, he stammers… She understands right away: Juliette is a wedding planner, so he wants to marry her!</span></p><p><strong>Actors</strong><span>: In this film, you’ll discover many famous actors! Watch out for the dark beauty of Nicolas Devauchelle who plays the role of Matthias. Sylvie Testud, François-Xavier Demaison, Lionel Astier and Chantal Lauby complete the cast.</span></p><h3><b>3. L’Ascension</b></h3><p><span><strong>Genre</strong>: comedy</span></p><p><strong>Synopsis</strong><span>: Out of love for Nadia, Samy leaves his council estate and goes to climb Mount Everest. A departure that soon thrills the whole of France, it is full of emotion and documents the exploits of this ordinary but in love young man. In the end, it has a clear message of hope: it’s up to each of us to invent our own future as anything is possible.</span></p><p><span>The film is roughly inspired by Nadir Dendoune’s book </span><i><span>Un tocard sur le toit du monde</span></i><span> (A Loser on the Roof of the World), which tells the story of Nadir Dendoune. Unlike so many films, </span><i><span>L’Ascension</span></i><span> is not a film that relays clichés about the suburbs and is a sincere and endearing feel-good movie.</span></p><h3><span><strong>4.</strong> </span><b>Nothing to hide</b><span> (Le jeu)</span></h3><p><strong>Genre</strong>: <span>comedy-drama</span></p><p><strong>Synopsis</strong><span>: During a dinner party, a couple of friends decide to play a “game”: everyone has to put their mobile phone in the middle of the table and every SMS, phone call, email, Facebook message,… will have to be shared with the others. It won’t be long before this “game” turns into a nightmare.</span></p><p><strong>Actors</strong><span>: Here again, you will meet some very famous French actors: Bérénice Bejo (who also played in the Oscar-winning film The artist, wife of the director), Vincent Elbaz or the Belgian actor Stephane de Groodt.</span></p><p><span>The story takes a long time to set up, and there are a few monotonous passages, but ” Le Jeu ” has everything to play with the spectator because a very ingenious final twist gives it all its spice!&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>5. The African Doctor</b><span> (</span><span>Bienvenue à Marly-Gomont</span><span>)</span></h3><p><span><strong>Genre</strong>: b</span><span>iography-comedy</span></p><p><strong>Synopsis</strong><span>: In 1975, Seyolo Zantoko, a freshly graduated doctor from Kinshasa, seizes the opportunity to become a country doctor in a small French village. </span><span>Arriving in Marly-Gomont, the inhabitants are afraid, but Seyolo is determined to succeed in his bet and will do everything possible to gain the villagers’ trust…</span></p><p><span>This film tells the story of the childhood of the rapper and comedian Kamini who made a “buzz” on the Internet in 2006 with his song “Marly-Gomont”.</span></p><p><span>Netflix is also known for its series but there are also some great cartoons! Some of them are just as interesting as movies: let yourself be tempted by </span><i><span>My life as a</span></i><i><span> courgette</span></i><span>, a Swiss animated film, full of tenderness! Or </span><i><span>The Twelve Tasks of Asterix</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>The Adventures of Tintin</span></i><span>! Netflix is full of resources to accompany you in&nbsp; your language learning journey, in addition to <span><strong><a href=#>courses with Lingoda, of course!</a></strong></span></span></p><p>If you’d like to stop using subtitles when you’re watching a French film then start learning French today!

She comes from the west of France, and after living 2 years in Spain and 4 years in Oxford in England, she has just settled in the heart of France, in Auvergne, a land of cheese, rugby, Michelin tires and ancient volcanoes. Audrey definitely prefers the first one. She speaks French, Spanish and English, and just started German, nothing better to understand her students who tremble at the French grammar! When she is not teaching, she tries to find time to cook or sing in a choir. She loves to invite people to her house to feed them and trap them with musical blind tests designed and adapted to her guests!
