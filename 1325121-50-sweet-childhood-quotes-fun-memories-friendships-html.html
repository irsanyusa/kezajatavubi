This is because life is full of ups and downs, and each of these experiences serves to teach a lesson, as well as mould us for life ahead.</p><h2>Which are the best childhood quotes?</h2><p class=align-left>Deep down, we are all young at heart despite our age. As adulthood demands responsibility, we sometimes tend to be caught up in solving the problems and situations of life. During this process, the playful side of us slowly fades away.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, we fail to enjoy the little things and moments that life offers us as we tend to be caught up trying to achieve big goals and make our lives as comfortable and appealing as they can be.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99c85b7cb88bbac6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful healing quotes to help you get through the tough times</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Therefore, it is necessary to take a look at a variety of <a id=https://www.bustle.com/p/16-quotes-about-childhood-friendship-on-national-best-friends-day-to-make-you-want-to-hug-your-literal-bff-63081 href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">childhood friendship quotes</a>, as well as other related ones, to remind us of what life was like, sharing them with the people most dear to us.</p><h3>10 incredible quotes on childhood memories</h3><p class=align-left>One of the commonly used terms used to describe a toddler is ‘innocent’. This is because young ones carry a lot of innocence as they are not yet exposed to the world and all the problems that life can sometimes bring to us.</p><p class=align-left>Once in a while, it is important that we take a mental or emotional ride back to the good old times to remind ourselves of who we truly were before the influence of the world took over, despite how minimal the impact may be.</p><ul><li>Happy times come and go, but the memories stay forever.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99c85b7cb88bbac6.jpg><ul><li>Childhood is the fiery furnace in which we are melted down to essentials, and that essential shaped for good.</li><li>The older I grow, the more earnestly I feel that the few joys of childhood are the best that life has to give.</li><li>Childhood is like a mirror, which reflects in the afterlife the images first presented to it. The first thing continues forever with the young one. The first joy, the first sorrow, the first success, the first failure, the first achievement, the first misadventure paints the foreground of his life.</li><li>We see how early childhood experiences are so important to lifelong outcomes, how the early environment literally becomes embedded in the brain and changes its architecture.</li><li>Enjoy the little things; one day, you may look back and realize they were the big things.</li><li>There is a garden in every childhood, an enchanted place where colors are brighter, the air softer, and the morning more fragrant than ever again.</li><li>Some days I wish I could go back in life. Not to change anything, but to feel a few things twice.</li><li>Their dark forms are larger than life, because memories like that grow along with your body, so that adults from our childhood always resemble an extinct race of old gods, still towering over us.</li><li>Sometimes, it is better to bunk a class and enjoy with loved ones, because now, when I look back, marks never make me laugh, but memories do.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e758df8f65c61b80.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Fascinating facts about Illusory correlation: Definition and examples</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is rare to describe an adult using the terms’ innocent’ and ‘pure’. As a human being grows older, he or she goes through experiences that take away a portion of these traits. This could be as a result of one’s environment or method of upbringing.</p><p class=align-left>As these are the little things that make us remain human, ensure that you take some time to tap back into your younger self whenever you feel like you are getting out of control.</p><h3>10 beautiful quotes on childhood friends</h3><p class=align-left><a id=https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/childhood-friends href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Childhood friends quotes</a> remind us of those loved ones who stuck by us during both the good and bad times.

With old friends, you've got your whole life in common.</li><li>A loved one is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself, and especially, to feel, or not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at any moment is fine with them. That is what real love amounts to; letting a person be what he really is.</li><li>Friendship is the hardest thing in the world to explain. It is not something you learn in school.

Do not walk away, do not be distracted, do not be too busy or tired, and do not take them for granted. Real ones are part of the glue that holds life and faith together. Powerful stuff.</li><li>When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f05e069c9125f85a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 of the most inspiring Paulo Coelho quotes</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Life is far much more interesting when you have someone who understands you, regardless of whatever you could be going through.
